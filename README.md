# SMAI-Arduino
This project involves the development of a microcontroller prototype designed for the real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity. The system is built to provide data feedback in a versatile and immediate manner. Information is presented locally in two formats: text on an LCD display and graphics on a TFT screen. Additionally, the system is equipped with wireless communication (Bluetooth), which allows for the remote consultation of monitoring data via an external device, facilitating portability and continuous analysis.
